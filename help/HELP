This file has the main objetive of showing what code examples to follow and what each one covers.
All the examples are located in the src/ directory.
Note that the order of the files presented is the recommended order to follow as a beginner

files:
    main.c:
        covers:
            basic embedded code structure, essential include files
        note:
            a simple skeleton code example, made to play around   

    blink.c:
        covers:
            basic digital output, data direction registers
        note:
            just blink an LED on and off forever, a kind of hello world for embedded systems 
    
    input.c:
        covers:
            basic logical operations (AND and XOR), digital input, making the code more responsive to the user
        note:
            creating a responsive input while other events still happen is not that simple, pretty good to teach many basic ideas

    interrupt-8-bit-timer.c:
        covers:
            basic interrupt handling, timers, working around 8 bit restrictions, how the datasheet is important
        note:
            interrupts are essential for multitasking in any system, however heavly dependent on the microcontroller used

    interrupt-16-bit-timer.c:
        covers:
            interrupt handling with another type of register
        note:
            important for the future pwm handling as the same timer can be used, while also reafirming the importance of the datasheet


    pwm.c:
        covers:

        note:
