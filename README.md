# AVR C Basics
Basic AVR-C programs made for testing and learning purposes, tested on Arduino UNO (atmega328p)



Build instructions: issue "make FILE=<name of the source file inside src/ (without the .c)>" to build the file. To flash to a board use "sudo make flash" (the superuser privileges are necessary for avrdude).
